## 💡 Tips for Success

### Using the Quiz Application
1. **First Pass**: Complete all 300 to establish baseline
2. **Review Mode**: Use "Review Answer" for every incorrect response
3. **Targeted Practice**: Focus on low-scoring knowledge areas
4. **Timed Practice**: Simulate exam conditions (time yourself)
5. **Multiple Attempts**: Questions randomize - take quiz many times

### Study Strategies
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review questions over multiple days
- **Active Learning**: Explain answers in your own words
- **Peer Discussion**: Discuss tricky questions with study partners
- **Real-World Application**: Connect concepts to actual projects
- **Note Taking**: Keep a study journal of key concepts

### Test-Taking Tips
- **Read Carefully**: Questions may have subtle distinctions
- **Process of Elimination**: Rule out obviously wrong answers
- **Knowledge Area Awareness**: Use topic hints to recall concepts
- **Time Management**: Don't spend too long on any one question
- **Review Flagged Items**: Mark difficult questions for review

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Quiz won't start
- **Fix**: Install tkinter (see QUICK_START.md)

**Issue**: File not found errors
- **Fix**: Ensure all .md files are in same directory as .py file

**Issue**: Questions seem repetitive
- **Fix**: This is expected - restart app for new random order

**Issue**: All answers are "B"
- **Fix**: Answer positions are randomized in GUI; correct answers vary
