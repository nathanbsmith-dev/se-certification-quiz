- **Explanation:** Qualification testing formally demonstrates requirement compliance, often required for certification or acceptance.

**64. B** - Tools and test data configured to test a component or system
- **Explanation:** A test harness provides the environment, drivers, stubs, and data needed to execute tests in isolation.

**65. B** - Early in the lifecycle, planned from the start
- **Explanation:** V&V planning should begin during requirements development, with strategies and criteria established early.

### Section 5: Risk Management

**66. B** - An uncertain event that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on objectives
- **Explanation:** Risks are uncertain future events that could impact project objectives; they can be threats (negative) or opportunities (positive).

**67. B** - Identification, analysis, mitigation planning, tracking, and control
- **Explanation:** Comprehensive risk management is a continuous process throughout the project lifecycle.

**68. B** - The probability that a risk event will occur
- **Explanation:** Likelihood (or probability) is typically rated as low, medium, high or given numerical probabilities.

**69. B** - The consequence or effect if the risk occurs
- **Explanation:** Impact assesses the severity of consequences on cost, schedule, performance, or other objectives.

**70. B** - Likelihood versus impact to prioritize risks
- **Explanation:** Risk matrices plot probability versus consequence, helping prioritize which risks need the most attention.

**71. B** - Avoidance, reduction, transfer, and acceptance
- **Explanation:** These four strategies address risks: eliminate the threat, reduce probability/impact, shift to others, or acknowledge and monitor.

**72. B** - Risk remaining after mitigation measures are applied
- **Explanation:** Even after mitigation, some level of risk typically remains; this residual risk must be accepted or further addressed.

**73. B** - An indicator that a risk event is about to occur or has occurred
- **Explanation:** Triggers are warning signs or conditions that signal a risk is materializing, prompting contingency actions.

**74. B** - Preparing alternative courses of action if risks materialize
- **Explanation:** Contingency plans define specific actions to take if identified risks occur, enabling rapid response.

**75. B** - Transfer (e.g., insurance, contracts)
- **Explanation:** Risk transfer shifts consequences to another party through insurance, warranties, or contractual clauses.

### Section 6: Project Management & Planning

**76. B** - Hierarchical decomposition of project work into manageable tasks
- **Explanation:** The WBS breaks down project deliverables and work into smaller, manageable components organized hierarchically.

**77. B** - The longest path determining minimum project duration
- **Explanation:** The critical path has zero float; any delay on these tasks directly extends project completion time.

**78. B** - The amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying the project
- **Explanation:** Float (slack) is schedule flexibility; tasks with float can slip without affecting the end date.

**79. B** - Scope, schedule, and cost to assess project performance
- **Explanation:** EVM compares planned value, earned value, and actual cost to provide objective performance measures.

**80. B** - An approved reference point for scope, schedule, and cost
- **Explanation:** Baselines are formally approved versions of plans against which performance is measured and changes are controlled.

**81. B** - Tasks, durations, and dependencies over time
- **Explanation:** Gantt charts show tasks as bars along a timeline, visualizing schedule, dependencies, and progress.

**82. B** - Uncontrolled expansion of project scope without adjustments
- **Explanation:** Scope creep occurs when additional features are added without proper change control, impacting schedule and budget.

**83. B** - Formal authorization and high-level definition of the project
- **Explanation:** The charter formally authorizes the project, names the project manager, and defines high-level objectives and constraints.

**84. B** - Balance resource usage to avoid over-allocation
- **Explanation:** Resource leveling adjusts the schedule to resolve over-allocations, smoothing resource demand over time.

**85. B** - A significant point or event marking progress
- **Explanation:** Milestones are zero-duration events marking important achievements or decision points in the schedule.

### Section 7: Quality, Reliability & Maintainability

**86. B** - The probability a system performs its function without failure over time
- **Explanation:** Reliability quantifies how consistently a system operates successfully under specified conditions for a specified period.

**87. B** - Average time between successive failures
- **Explanation:** MTBF measures reliability for repairable systems—the longer the MTBF, the more reliable the system.

**88. B** - Average time required to repair a failed component
- **Explanation:** MTTR measures maintainability—how quickly a system can be restored to operation after failure.

**89. B** - MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR) or similar formulas
- **Explanation:** Availability represents the proportion of time a system is operational: Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime).

**90. B** - The ability of a system to continue operating despite failures
- **Explanation:** Fault-tolerant systems use redundancy and error detection/correction to maintain functionality during failures.

**91. B** - On a scheduled basis to prevent failures
- **Explanation:** Preventive (or preventative) maintenance is performed proactively on a schedule to reduce failure probability.

**92. B** - Systematic analysis of potential failure modes and their impacts
- **Explanation:** FMEA identifies ways components can fail and assesses the effects, helping prioritize design improvements.

**93. B** - Failure rates over time: infant mortality, useful life, wear-out
- **Explanation:** The bathtub curve shows high early failure rates (burn-in), low constant rates (useful life), and increasing wear-out failures.

**94. B** - Reliability and availability by providing backup components
- **Explanation:** Redundant components allow the system to continue functioning when one fails, improving overall reliability.

**95. B** - Preventing defects through process improvement
- **Explanation:** Quality assurance focuses on the processes used to develop the system, preventing defects rather than just detecting them.

### Section 8: Advanced Topics

**96. B** - Multiple independent systems integrated to provide new capabilities
- **Explanation:** SoS involves operationally and managerially independent systems collaborating to achieve capabilities beyond individual systems.

**97. B** - Virtual replicas of physical systems used for simulation and analysis
- **Explanation:** Digital twins are dynamic virtual models synchronized with physical counterparts, enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization.

**98. B** - Tracking actual vs. planned technical parameters during development
- **Explanation:** TPM monitors key performance parameters (weight, power, speed) against targets to detect deviations early.

**99. B** - Multiple layers of security controls throughout the system
- **Explanation:** Defense in depth uses redundant, layered security measures so if one fails, others provide protection.

**100. B** - Document how systems engineering will be applied to the project
- **Explanation:** The SEMP describes the SE processes, activities, organization, schedules, and resources for a specific project.
