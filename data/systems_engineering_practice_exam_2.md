**79. B** - An approved configuration at a specific time
- **Explanation:** Baselines are reference configurations against which changes are measured and controlled.

**80. B** - Recording and reporting of configuration information and changes
- **Explanation:** Status accounting tracks baseline configurations, approved changes, and implementation status.

**81. B** - That the product conforms to configuration documentation
- **Explanation:** Configuration audits verify the physical product matches its technical documentation.

**82. B** - Proposed modifications to baselined configurations
- **Explanation:** ECPs formally document proposed changes, including rationale, impacts, and implementation approach.

**83. B** - Changes to documents and software over time
- **Explanation:** Version control tracks revisions, enabling retrieval of previous versions and managing parallel development.

**84. B** - Reviewing and approving/rejecting proposed changes
- **Explanation:** The CCB has authority to approve changes, ensuring coordination and proper impact assessment.

**85. B** - After system requirements are approved
- **Explanation:** The functional baseline is established at System Requirements Review, documenting approved system requirements.

### Section 7: Specialty Engineering

**86. B** - Optimizing human-system interaction and performance
- **Explanation:** Human factors engineering designs systems around human capabilities and limitations for safety, efficiency, and satisfaction.

**87. B** - Equipment functions without electromagnetic interference
- **Explanation:** EMC ensures equipment neither generates harmful interference nor is susceptible to interference from other sources.

**88. B** - Identify and mitigate hazards throughout the lifecycle
- **Explanation:** System safety systematically identifies hazards and implements controls to reduce risks to acceptable levels.

**89. B** - Criticality ranking of failure effects
- **Explanation:** FMECA extends FMEA by assigning criticality levels based on severity and probability, prioritizing mitigation efforts.

**90. B** - A top-down deductive method to analyze failure causes
- **Explanation:** FTA starts with an undesired event and works backward to identify contributing causes and combinations.

**91. B** - Predicts reliability improvement during testing and fixes
- **Explanation:** Reliability growth models track reliability increases as failures are found and fixed during development testing.

**92. B** - Ensuring the system operates in its intended environment
- **Explanation:** Environmental engineering addresses temperature, humidity, vibration, altitude, and other environmental factors.

**93. B** - System malfunction or degraded performance
- **Explanation:** EMI can disrupt signals, cause errors, degrade performance, or in extreme cases, damage components.

**94. B** - Failure could result in death, injury, or environmental harm
- **Explanation:** Safety-critical systems require rigorous hazard analysis and mitigation because failures have catastrophic consequences.

**95. B** - The system can be efficiently tested and diagnosed
- **Explanation:** Testability engineering incorporates features enabling effective testing and fault isolation, reducing lifecycle costs.

- **Explanation:** ILS integrates planning for spares, support equipment, facilities, personnel, training, documentation, and technical data.

**97. B** - All costs over the system lifecycle including operation and support
- **Explanation:** TCO includes acquisition, operation, maintenance, and disposal costs, often dominated by O&S costs.

**98. B** - Where maintenance should be performed (organizational, intermediate, depot)
- **Explanation:** Level of repair analysis determines the most cost-effective location for each maintenance task.

**99. B** - Determining and acquiring spare parts and support equipment
- **Explanation:** Provisioning ensures the right spares and support equipment are available when and where needed.

**100. B** - Support resource requirements throughout the system lifecycle
- **Explanation:** LSA systematically analyzes support needs, informing design decisions and support planning.
